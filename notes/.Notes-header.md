These are my notes for the Language Server Protocol, dictated by Microsoft at the link below. This is really just for personal use / research and not indicitive of the projetcs features or scale - for that, read the readme as well as any other associated docs.
This will still be helpful for those who are trying to learn more about LSPs through this project, as my notes are a less formal lens of the spec itself.
If you have any questions about these notes - or spot something is incomplete for the version I have updated this to, please reach out to me via rajveer@sandhuhome.uk.
